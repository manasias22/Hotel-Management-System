# Hotel-Management-System


## Abstract

The Project Hotel Management System is a web based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very flexible and convenient. The hotel manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This application gives him the power and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single online system. The Hotel Management project provides room booking, staff management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system. Customers can view and book room online. Admin has the power of either approving or disapproving the customer's booking request. Other hotel services can also be viewed by the customers and can book them too.
